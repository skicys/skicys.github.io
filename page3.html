            <p>Usually, when a monster is Summoned to a Main Monster Zone, its controller chooses the Main Monster Zone to summon it to. For monsters that are Special Summoned to the opposing field by their own summoning condition (such as "Lava Golem"), or an effect that does so (such as "Ojama Trio"), the owner of the card or activator of the effect chooses the zones to summon them to, whereas for an effect that makes both players Special Summon (such as "Crashbug Road"), each player chooses the zones of their own monsters to summon them to.

            <p>Spell & Trap Zones, are the 5 Zones in which Spell and Trap Cards can be placed on the field (except Field Spell Cards, which are placed in the Field Zone). They are located in the middle of the field behind the Monster Zones; for this reason, they are also sometimes unofficially referred to as "backrow." On game mats, they are often colored cyan.
